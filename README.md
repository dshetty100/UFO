# UFO Project

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a webpage that uses JavaScript in the HTML page for displaying UFO sightings data as a table and having the ability to filter the data based on multiple criteria such as, date of sighting, city of a sighting, state of a sighting, country of a sighting, and shape of UFO, as defined by users. 

In this project, JavaScript (app.js) builds the HTML table and fills it with data that is stored in data.js as a JavaScript array. The HTML file (index.html) contains all the filters for multiple criteria.


## Results
The webpage allows user to display and filter UFO sightings data based on multiple criteria at the same time.
For example, one could filter the data by filling the "Enter Date" field with "1/1/2010", "Enter a Country" field with "us", and "Enter a Shape" field with "sphere". This would display all the data related to sightings on 1/1/2010, in the US and that corresponding to spherical shape UFO.

## Summary
- The drawback of this webpage is that the filter needs to be manually cleared for new entries. It would be advantageous to have all clear button that would clear the older entries to enter new ones for the next search.
