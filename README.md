# UFO Project

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a webpage that uses JavaScript in the HTML page for displaying UFO sightings data as a table and having the ability to filter the data based on multiple criteria such as, date of sighting, city of a sighting, state of a sighting, country of a sighting, and shape of UFO, as defined by users. 

In this project, JavaScript (app.js) builds the HTML table and fills it with data that is stored in data.js as a JavaScript array. The HTML file (index.html) contains all the filters for multiple criteria.


## Results
The webpage can display UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.
For example, one could filter the data by entering the date field as "1/1/2010", country field as "us", and the shape field as "sphere". This would display as shown below all the data related to UFO sightings on 1/1/2010, in the US and one that is shperical in shape.

- The table below shows employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. There are 1,464 employees who are eligible for mentorship program. With large number of 
employees due for retirement, there may not be enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
